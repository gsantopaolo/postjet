# Commercial License (JetCourier)

Copyright (c) 2025 Gian Paolo Santopaolo

**1. Definitions.**
“**Software**” means the JetCourier code and accompanying materials.
“**Commercial Use**” means any use by or for a for-profit entity, or in connection with providing products or services for a fee, internal business operations of a for-profit entity, or deployment in production or customer-facing environments.
“**Noncommercial Use**” is governed by the PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 license in this repository.

**2. Grant.**
Subject to a separate **written permission or contract** with Licensor and **payment of applicable fees**, Licensor grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide license to use, modify, and distribute the Software **for Commercial Use**, including internal use and as part of your products or services.

**3. Fees & Scope.**
Commercial licensing **requires a fee**, which may be **one-time** or **recurring (e.g., yearly)** and may vary based on your usage (e.g., seats, volume, features, deployment scale). The contract or order form will specify the fee, scope, and limits.

**4. No Commercial Use Without License.**
Without an executed commercial contract or written permission from Licensor, **Commercial Use is not permitted**. The public license in this repo (PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0) allows only Noncommercial Use.

**5. Telemetry & Compliance Verification.**
The Software **may collect and transmit limited telemetry** to Licensor solely to detect unauthorized Commercial Use and improve the Software. Telemetry may include product/version, feature flags, coarse environment metadata, and usage counters, **but not message contents**. Telemetry will be processed in accordance with applicable law and Licensor’s privacy notice. Where required, you must **provide notice and obtain consent** from users before enabling telemetry. You may request documentation of telemetry data categories. If your contract permits, Licensor may request reasonable usage attestations or logs to verify compliance (no more than once per year unless breach is suspected).

**6. Restrictions.**
You may not remove or alter copyright, license, or trademark notices. You may not use Licensor’s names or marks to endorse or promote derivative works without prior permission. Sublicensing is allowed only as expressly permitted in your contract.

**7. Ownership.**
Licensor retains all rights, title, and interest in and to the Software not expressly granted.

**8. Support & Updates.**
If purchased, support and update terms are defined in your order form or contract.

**9. Warranty & Liability.**
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, LICENSOR DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AND LICENSOR’S TOTAL LIABILITY SHALL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU FOR THE LICENSE DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

**10. Term & Termination.**
This license is effective upon execution of your commercial contract and continues unless terminated. Licensor may terminate for your material breach if not cured within thirty (30) days of notice (or immediately for non-payment or unauthorized Commercial Use). Upon termination, you must cease Commercial Use. Sections 5–11 survive termination.

**11. Governing Law and Jurisdiction.**
This License and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it shall be governed by 
the substantive laws of **Switzerland**, excluding its conflict-of-law rules and the 
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG). 
The parties submit to the **exclusive jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of the City of Lugano, Canton of 
Ticino, Switzerland**. Either party may seek injunctive or equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction 
to protect its intellectual property or confidential information.
